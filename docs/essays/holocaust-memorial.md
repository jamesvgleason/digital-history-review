It would be kind of crazy to think a place like Albuquerque, New Mexico would have a holocaust memorial.And if they did then why would they ? Well for starters New Mexico is also a place of that has held numerous immigrants. With having people from different backgrounds means different cultures. Here in New Mexico there is many items around the state representing different cultures. As in the likes of artwork, food, music, clothes. Obviously the holocaust is apart the worlds history, but extremely apart of the jewish people's history.

## Busy Area
The Monument is located in downtown Alburquerque. Off of third and Tijeras, in a very busy part of that area. The monument is located in front of a Hyatt hotel, across the street from the a Bank of Albuquerque, right by a parking garage entrance.There are tons of trees without branches that surround the art piece, which makes the art piece hard to see because the way it blinds in with the trees so well. Yes the monument is in a very good place where it can be noticed, but it is also in a place where it can go unnoticed. Due to the places that are in the surrounding area of the monument, a lot of people just come and go. Not really looking at the monument realizing the art put into it. If a person is standing at the Bank of Alburquerque across the street, they honsetly just might think it's a tree. If a person is by the parking garage they might actually glance at the piece, but think nothing of it.

## The Building Itself
The Holocaust mounment was built in 1998 by a sculptor Jake Lovato. There were also other designers on the building whose names are listed on the memorial. The date it was officially dediacted to the city was January 1st 1998.[^source] The monument was built with steel and granite pillars. The look of the building is a metal sculpture that depicts bodies rising in a smoke stack. Five triangular columns(panels) surrounding the sculpture and each columns includes info about the holocaust. Letting people know about important events of the holocaust and some things that went on during that period. Obviously with it being a memorial you can go visit it. Admission is free but some form of ID is required of the people visiting at the site. From a distance most people would think it is honestly nothing important. When the mounment lights at night or early in the afternoon when near it you can see the people and the smoke on the mounment.

## Representation
  This monmemt does represent the jewish people and shines light on holocaust, but this monment represents just more than the jewish community. It shines a light on the different cultures that can be found here in New Mexico. You can find different items symbolizing different cultures around here in New Mexico[^source2]. Like there are certain pieces of art representing the African American culture throughout the city of Alburquerque.This sticks out because not very many states have as many cultures as New Mexico does, or they don't embrace as much. This what help makes the New Mexico landscpae so great, is the diverse shown throughout the landscape.This helps shows the great deal of respect that New Mexico has for it's people and the places that they came from.














## Invisible Art
 What makes this art piece so invisible is the fact people everyday walk, drive past it without really noticing that it's there.Even on the internet you won't find nothing more than the basic information on the piece. Google won't tell you why it was built, how the artist came up with this idea and etc. That is due to people simply not caring enough about the piece. Google hardly mentions the controversy surrounding the monument. While the monument was going through the process of getting built, there was a group of jewish people who did not want monument up. They felt like the monument was glorifying the holocaust, especially with people burning in smoke sculpted out on monument. Obviously knowing what happened in holocaust who would what to see a art piece like dat put out in the public. Nobody will never know the artist true intentions on building the monument, so for that all people can do is wonder.
