It would be kind of crazy to think a place like Albuquerque, New Mexico would have a holocaust memorial.And if they did then why would they ? Well for starters New Mexico is also a place of that has held numerous immigrants. With having people from different backgrounds means different cultures. Here in New Mexico there is many items around the state representing different cultures. As in the likes of artwork, food, music, clothes. Obviously the holocaust is apart the worlds history, but extremely apart of the jewish people's history.

## The Location
The Monument is located in downtown Alburquerque[^source2]. Even though this is very important monument, you'll be surprised that this piece is hidden. The monument is surrounded by a parking garage, couple of benches, and more important a sidewalk. Now this sidewalk means one or two things either a lot people pass by it, or nobody passes by it all. Usually the downtown area is somewhere you can get the best feel for the city. That is also where most of the culture throughout the city can be found. To be surrounded by other businesses can this piece of art hidden, and keeps this piece from standing out. With so much other businesses, restaurants, other kinds of attractions. This piece just becomes another statue that most people do not care to notice.

The Holocaust mounment was built in 1998 by a sculptor Jake Lovato. There were also other designers on the building whose names are listed on the memorial. The date it was officially dediacted to the city was January 1st 1998.[^source] The monument was built with steel and granite pillars. The look of the building is a metal sculpture that depicts bodies rising in a smoke stack. Five triangular columns(panels) surrounding the sculpture and each columns includes info about the holocaust. Letting people know about important events of the holocaust and some things that went on during that period. Obviously with it being a memorial you can go visit it. Admission is free but some form of ID is required of the people visiting at the site. From a distance most people would think it is honestly nothing important. When the mounment lights at night or early in the afternoon when near it you can see the people and the smoke on the mounment.

## Representation
  This monmemt does represent the jewish people and what they went through during the holocaust. This monment represents the other pieces of different cultures that New Mexico has here. You can find different items symbolizing different cultures around here in New Mexico. This just happens to be one of them.This sticks out because not very many states have as many cultures as New Mexico does, or they don't embrace as much.Which shows the great deal of respect that New Mexico has for it's people.














## Controversy
While the monument was going through the process of getting built, there was a group of jewish people who did not want monument up. They felt like the monument's figure showed too much. Due to the monument showing people burning in smoke. Which was something that exactly happened during the Holocaust.
