The Parq Central Hotel is now a source of economic stability through the steady flow of tourists. However, it was originally known as the Santa Fe Railway Hospital which was [created out of necessity](https://web.stanford.edu/group/spatialhistory/cgi-bin/site/pub.php?id=65) in 1926 in order to [treat injured railway workers](http://www.kansasmemory.org/item/227818)[^Injured-workers]. Three buildings were created: the hospital, the physician's residence, and the boiler building. Later, it would be repurposed as a mental institution for children before it would be considered a [historic site](https://www.cabq.gov/planning/boards-commissions/landmarks-urban-conservation-commission/historic-landmarks).




## Purpose of the Santa Fe Railway Hospital & Memorial Hospital

Medical assistance was provided for railway workers and later medical treatment for mentally ill children. Beyond this however, the cultural perception and meaning of the space literally began to create a community around it; later supporting another mode of transportation when the freeway and streets were built around it marking its importance.The [Santa Fe Railway Hospital](http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20130520-a-hospital-turned-hotel-in-new-mexico) as well as the Memorial Hospital served their purpose by redefining the space in which it occupied.

The chosen [Italianate architecture style](http://www.phmc.state.pa.us/portal/communities/architecture/styles/late-19th-century-revival.html)[^Italianate] was popular from 1890-1930 reminiscent of the Italian Renaissance; this style was considered elegant, up-scale, and primarily used for designing mansions or public buildings. Recently, renovations to refurbish Memorial Hospital into the Parq Central Hotel consisted of reconditioning and reinstalling the original windows, maintaining the original interior doors (hospital building), utilizing the original buildings, and the addition of exterior suites.

## Cultural Memory and Space

Space is more than a geographical representation, mistakenly thought of as only coordinates. Space is a story that contains history while sharing a dialectical relationship by being static and simultaneously dynamic. Static in the sense that it will always be there, have things built on or around it, used and re-used, and will serve some purpose. And dynamic in the sense that its purpose changes due to intent (i.e. if it no longer serves its purpose then a new one will be found).

The Santa Fe Railway Hospital as well as the Memorial Hospital's original purpose was to provide medical treatment and then shifted to promoting economic growth and a place for social gatherings. The purpose affected the cultural memory of this space by influencing people's perception of it. Space is more than a physical place because it directly shapes our memory, which anyone can be a part of.

The Parq Central Hotel did serve its purpose in boosting the economy by using historical memory, modern perspective [(renovation)](http://www.studioswarch.com/clone-hotel-parq-central), and an exotic appeal to successfully promote tourism. The historical memory allows guests to visit a historical landmark[^Landmark] that provided a vital service during [railroad construction westward](http://www.downtownacd.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Central-Downtown-History-Architecture-.pdf). Modern perspective combined historical memory with a modern touch of comfort to create a pleasing experience. An exotic appeal is the signature brand of New Mexican culture by highlighting local features, creating an oasis in the desert.
