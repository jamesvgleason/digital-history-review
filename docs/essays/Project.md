# Civiv Plaza's Holocaust Memorial
Dequez Irving

It would be kind of crazy to think a place like Albuquerque, New Mexico would have a holocaust memorial.And if they did then why would they ? Well for starters New Mexico is also a place of that has held numerous immigrants. With having people from different backgrounds means different cultures. Here in New Mexico there is many items around the state representing different cultures. As in the likes of artwork, food, music, clothes. Obviously the holocaust is apart the worlds history, but extremely apart of the jewish people's history.

## The Location
The Monument is located in downtown Alburquerque. Now for the monument there is pros and cons for it to be placed downtown. A pro can be the fact when most people come and visit, what do they like to ride through ? Obviously the downtown areas. Usually the downtown area is somewhere you can get the best feel for the city. That is also where most of the culture throughout the city can be found. A con be the same as the pro, is the fact that people just ride through downtown. They will not stop just to see a monument. Unless they are really into art or they know what the piece means. Most people won't care to know what the piece means or what it stands for. Regardless downtown is the best place for monument, because when people ride pass it they have to see it. Whether you want to or not. There probably people who have lived in Albuquerque all their life and never just stopped to look at the monument. So it being downtown gives them that chance to just look at it because it's easy found.
