Enjoying a *[Marble Brewery](http://www.marblebrewery.com/) Pale Ale* while watching a reggae, hip-hop, or rock concert at Sunshine Theater is an experience that most people fail to appreciate for many reasons. First, some locals may think that the venue quality of Sunshine Theater is not as good as other venues downtown. Second, the aging facade is considered as an eye sore to by some locals. Third, many lack any other historical knowledge about the building besides the use of a concert hall by locals. As Albuquerquens, it is our duty to carry the history of our city in to the future as well as to remember all the places that make up and have made up our city skyline. So, this essay is an attempt to give a greater understanding to importance of the Sunshine Building to the local community as well as visitors to Albuquerque.

### History

The Sunshine building is most famously known to some as "Albuquerque's original cinematic palace [2]." However, it is important to look at the overall influence that the construction of the Sunshine "theatre" had on the history of Albuquerque alongside being one of the city's first movie theaters. Before the Sunshine building was built, it was located on what was known as The White Elephant which was a saloon that closed down in 1920 due to prohibition[8]. The saloon was owned by Joseph Barnett who moved to New Mexico from New York in 1883 and was involved in real estate until he eventually became a local entertainment entrepreneur whom, at one point, owned most of the city's theaters. Barnett then went on to hire noted architect Henry C. Trost of Trost & Trost in El Paso to build Sunshine Theatre which would include a 920 seat theater and become the second sky scraper in downtown Albuquerque [9].

The theater was built in "a symmetrical Beaux Arts style not unlike the detailing that its architect Henry Trost had given to the new bank, a block west on Central Avenue" and

In addition to the building was a neon Sunshine sign which later added to the facade and created the classic 'Route 66' feeling when visiting the theatre. Another notable historical fact in the building of the 'Sunshine theatre' is that Trost also led southwest construction techniques with the use of reinforced concrete as a construction material which was then covered with the yellow brick and is the facade that currently exists today. Also, the building included an attendant operated elevator used for patrons viewing the from the balcony of the 'theatre' which is what gave the building historic value, along with the oak lobby boasts and facade, when it was registered for the National Registrar of Historic Places in 1985 [8]. The theatre opened its doors on May 1, 1924 with the showing of "Scaramouche" featuring actor Ramon Navarro and included a live orchestra to accompany the silent black and white film.

The building also includes offices on the upper levels of the building that housed F.D. Fogg and Company, a fine jewelry retailer that closed in 1970 [1]and was also the site of the first meetings of Congregation B’nai Israel which connects the building to history of the current day New Mexico Historical Jewish Society. The theatre continued to show films in to the 1960s when the interior was almost completely remodeled to allow an installation of a large movie screen for feature film screenings. Sunshine remained in operation until 1974 when the theatre stopped showing first-run movies but then eventually closed its doors as a movie theatre in 1980 and was seriously threatened with demolition in 1984 [7]. The efforts to save the iconic Sunshine building were finally appeased when the city declared it as a historic landmark in 1985. The final renovation to the building came in 1990s when the theatre was renovated its current day purpose in the downtown which is a live music performance venue and has hosted some well-known acts such as: Strokes, Snoop Dogg, Stone Temple Pilots, The Smashing Pumpkins, Modest Mouse, Rancid, Coheed and Cambria, Social Distortion, Deftones, Deadmau5, and many others.

Today, a quick drive by the Sunshine building or a google search on Google maps will reveal that is now a concert stage for artists visiting Albuquerque and more specifically important to the youth being one of the few underage concert venues in town. Another quick search on google will also reveal yelp reviews of the venues current condition which include: sound quality in theater being really bad, restrooms falling apart, venue layout being too small for crowds that tickets sales allow, the balcony not being opened for concerts, and the most commented on was the customer service given by staff, bartenders, and security in the venue. One review, from a resident that moved to Albuquerque, praised the small venue sized because it is much more of an intimate setting which allows for anyone in the  theater to have the opportunity to be in the front row of any concert and makes for more of an memorable experience. Furthermore, if any patron goes early or stays after the concert, then there is a chance that they can get a glimpse or even a picture with the band or artist through the back stage entrance that leads out on to the street.

The building facade, however, is a depiction of the decades and many seasons that the building has seen due to the aging yellow bricks that cover majority of the building. 
Overall, the theater itself remains a main staple of the Sunshine Building and seems to not be facing any decline within the next chapters of downtown Albuquerque.
