## History 
In 1939, C.G. Wallace and S.D. Hambaugh took advantage of the automobile boom and built a motor lodge along busy Route 66 in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The motor lodge served as a cozy place for travellers to stay while driving through Albuquerque and also as an exhibit for Zuni art. Wallace developed a relationship with the Zuni Tribe through years of working on their reservation and soon became a trading post that exposed travllers to indigenous art from New Mexico.

## The Architecture & Location
The Spanish and Pueblo inspired architecture was a sole reflection of the vast culture Albuquerque had to offer. Adobe Pueblo style with arches and tight corners are shown in the structure of the De Anza. Later on in the 1950's, a coffee shop and gift shop were added to the motor lodge along with several other buildings. In 1957 a swimming pool was added to the two-point-five acre lot along Route 66. The original structure of the motor lodge was a two-story building and several one story building in a U-shape. The U-Shape structure alloswed customers to park right in front of their rooms creating a more convenient stay.

The incorporation of both Spanish and Pueblo inspiration made the De Anza Motor Lodge different than the surrounding motor lodges. The influence not only came from the culture of the state and city but of the art from the Zuni tribe. The surroudning area lacked the cultural influence that the De Anza had. Severing the De Anza from the surrounding was the fact that it sat on it's own property and did not share it with any other businesses other than the ones created by founder, Wallace, in an attempt to incorporate more into the motor lodge.

The De Anza Motor Lodge sat encased by four streets, Central and Copper running East/West and Graceland and Washington running North/South. The rectangluar property allowed for easy remodleing and a convenient location to access from Route 66.
The De Anza Motor Lodge sits on the same property that it was built on. The foundation in crumbles, the paint peeling, and the prpoperty guarded. Central, Route 66, ranges from a more modern to poverty stricken area. There ranges from thrift shops to modern shops to tents from homeless people. The motel sits within a mile of the University of New Mexico, which creates the surrounding neighborhood to be extremely diverse. Sitting next to it is a bank and on the other is shoe repair man store. Across from it lie a bar and a Thai resturant, a much different community than in it's prime. Currently, Central is under construction to introduce a new modern public transort system called A.R.T. (Albuquerque Rapod Transit). [^source3]

 ## The Hidden Gem of the De Anza Motor Lodge
The motor lodge itself represented a work of art. Before building the motor lodge Wallace began to form a bond with the Zuni tribe. The relationship Wallace cerated with the Zuni tribe helped the motor lodge connect people from the Zuni tribe to travellers from all over the U.S.. The motor lodge soon became a trading post that displayed various types of art created by the people of the Zuni tribe.

Wallace asked an artist from the Zuni tribe, Anthony Edaakie Sr., to paint a mural at the lodge to represent the presence of Zuni culture at the motor lodge. He had created a mural in the basement of the conference room at the De Anza Motor lodge. The mural repsresents the Zuni's winter *shalako* ceremony line. The mural follows east to west, symobolically. The leading procession *Shulawitsi*, meaning The Little Fire God, ending with the six *Salimopia*, meaning the gaurdians of the six cardnial directions of Zuni cosmology. The representative ideology of the Kachina's of the Zuni tribe portray beauty, color, and form of Zuni ceremony. [^source] 
## The Fate Of The De Anza Motor Lodge
After WWII in the late 1950's, hotel chains began to pop up and eventually put local motor lodges out of business. The remodling and changes Wallace had made to the De Anza had allowed it to stay in business much longer than many other motor lodges. The motor lodge was listed as American Automobile Association-approved accomodation until the ealry 1990's. C.G. Wallace died in 1993, shortly after the motor lodge was sold and continued this cycle until purchased by the city of Albuquerque. [^source2] 
### The Art Left Behind
The only art that isn't able to be displayed or sold is the mural in the basement. The mural in the basement has been the sole reason for preserving the historic De Anza Motor Lodge. Culture of the Zuni people has been eteched into the history of this building only for it to be hidden away.
