The architect, Joseph B. Burwinkle, combined his efforts with the Lembke Construction company to produce the El Rey Theater as it is today. Since 1981, the El Rey Theater building itself has solely been used to further bring art to as many people as possible in the form of musical shows. The architect's in-laws, the Bachechi's, built the *Kimo Theater* which, along with the El Rey Theater, is also an official *historical building of Albuequerque.*

Additionally, this location has breifly played host to some political happenings most well-known of which is the 'He Will Not Divide Us' protest orchestrated and orginally thought up by modern movies own, Shia Labeouf. As controversial as they were, one cannot argue the relevancy of his peaceful protests and that they, at the very least, mark a time-stamp of sorts in history for the El Rey's spatial history and that this building, and the space it occupies, played a role during the historic Trump Election through 'He Will Not Divide Us.'
