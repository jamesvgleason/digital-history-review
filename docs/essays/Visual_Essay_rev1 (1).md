# **Past & History**
The *Historic El Rey Theater*, located in downtown Albuquerque [here](https://www.google.com/maps/place/35%C2%B005'04.9%22N+106%C2%B039'18.0%22W/@35.084681,-106.6560843,18z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d35.084681!4d-106.65499>), has taken on many roles over the years including a grocery store, a few different bars, various kinds of shops, but mostly a movie theater and a venue for shows. The architect, Joseph B. Burwinkle, combined his efforts with the Lembke Construction company to produce the El Rey Theater as it is today. Since 1981, the El Rey Theater building itself has solely been used to further bring art to as many people as possible in the form of musical shows. The architects in-laws, the Bachechi's, built the *Kimo Theater* which, along with the El Rey Theater is also a historical building of Albuequerque.


## **The El Rey Today**
The El Rey Theater building is a work of art in architecture but Movie Theaters & concert halls specifically are a wonderful medium for facilitating the spread of even more art. Many musicians spanning all of the musical genres have been invited to play for anyone available at show time in Downtown Albuquerque. The theater prides itself on having brought  world renown artists and talent to the city including internationally famous acts such as the Chicano Brothers and even more famous musicians or bands like the *Black Label Society*, a rock/punk group who is extremely well known.

The Street the building resides on, Central, was once the central axis of commerce in Albuquerque. This can be physically experienced in very common traffic jams that happen right outside The El Rey Theater's spatial position on this ever popular east-west street. 

## **In Conclusion**
Not only is The Historic El Rey Theater a physical & visual piece of art regarding the actual building but it is a whole lot more. The building itself is a historical landmark and artful in its design & physical properties but its function since its inception but especially at present brings a great deal of musical art and cultural art by providing a space and necessary equipment to world renown artists, groups, bands, djs, and actors to anyone who wishes to particiapte in the city of Albuquerque.
