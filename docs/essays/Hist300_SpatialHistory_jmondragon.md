The “You Are Here” art project is an artwork display comprising of five colorful windows. It’s located in the Westside near Universe and Irving Road. The artwork is representation of Albuquerque’s Ventanas Ranch community. The purpose of this artwork is to make the visitor slowdown from their bustling life and appreciate their surroundings. The artwork was designed and created by Rachel Stevens. The project was constructed by many groups including the Albuquerque Public Art Program, Dona Ana Community College, and New Mexico State University. The artwork was dedicated in April 13, 2013. 

Rachel Stevens is a distinguished professor from New Mexico State University and is a sculpture instructor at the university.  She learned ancient copper casting techniques during her extensive travels in Nepal. 
### Appearance
The artwork is comprised of five windows but each is distinct in appearance. Each window is either painted in blue or green. The first window is green and the pane appears to held up by a soda can. It also has a charming bird located on the top-right of the window.

The second window is blue and has a pointed archway. It also has several window panes arranged in four rows and three columns. The third window is green and has a perfectly square frame. It also has for window panes. The fourth window is blue and is square. It’s slightly different from the previous display with its extended head portion. The last window display is green. It’s distinct from the previous with its bold and extend head portion. Each window has its own cranks and locks to open the windows but are nonfunctional. 

#### Space
The artwork is actually located in the Ventanas Ranch Park. The word “ventana” is actually Spanish for the work “window.” The artwork is perfectly located in a quiet, secluded, and open environment. The colorful artwork compliments the bright green trees and the pristine blue sky.  The artwork also does a good job in reflecting the harmony and tranquility of the environment. Each window is mounted on a concrete slabs which serve as seating for visitors. The windows are all arranged in a concave manner. The purpose of this design is to frame many points of view for the visitor which includes the Sandia Mountains, the park playground, or the nearby shopping center. Seating is encouraged at its base so that the visitor can observe and appreciate their surroundings.

Because it’s located in park, the convenient parking makes it completely accessible to view the artwork up close. A person can just step outside their vehicle and walk a short distance to view the artwork.  It can also be accessed by the sidewalks emerging from the playground or neighborhoods. The playground is directly located to the right of artwork.  A shopping center can be seen in the distance but isn’t too much of an interference to environment’s peacefulness.  
Because of its concave arrangement, some trees block the view of the windows. The blocking trees make it difficult to fully appreciate the scope of the artwork. The same can also be said about the protruding light posts from the nearby parking lot. The artwork is also situated near the entrance of the park. The noise of the approaching vehicles occasionally interrupts the tranquility of 
the artwork.  It also makes viewing the artwork from the opposite side slightly hazardous because of the approaching vehicles.
