# Acequias: Transformative Spaces of Tradition and Culture in the South Valley

### What is an Acequia?

Acequias, sometimes referred to as ‘ditches’ or ‘arroyos’ are community-based forms of sharing water used for irrigation that was first introduced to the people of New Mexico by the Spanish in the seventeenth-century (CESSOS.org). The acequia system of irrigation dates back to methods developed by the Moors and brought to the Iberian peninsula during their occupation of the region (ca.700-1492).

### The Valle Atrisco (South Valley)

The Valle Atrisco, commonly referred to the South Valley, is one of the oldest areas of Albuquerque owing its name to the Atrisco Land Grant of 1692 (CESSOS.org). The word "Atrisco" is derived from the Nahuatl word "Atlixo", which means “surface of a body of water (CESSOS.org)." and is an indication of how important acequias and water systems are to the area. The land grant was designed to spur settlement in the area and is still relatively intact to this day as families and individuals whose histories date back centuries still claim rights to land and water in the area despite public and private development (http://dev.newmexicohistory.org/). The acequia system played an integral part in irrigating the land to cultivate corn, wheat, beans, and alfalfa and allowed the area to grow and prosper throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries (http://dev.newmexicohistory.org/). Acequias were the critical point around which farmlands were built and maintained. The space surrounding acequias from the period of the seventeenth century up until the end of World War II was essentially rural farmland subdivided based on land grants (http://greenfiretimes.com/2015/11/the-genesis-of-acequias-in-atrisco-the-south-valley/).

### Acequias in the Valle Atrisco (South Valley)

There are five acequias that currently run through the South Valley, which are, Arenal, Armijo, Atrisco, Los Padillas and Pajarito. For the purposes of this spatial history project I have chosen to focus on the Arenal acequia. The space surrounding the acequias of the South Valley has changed exponentially over the past four centuries, all the while maintaining its importance to the the land and its community. I have chosen the Arenal acequia, specifically the area around the Sanchez Farms Open Space, because of its location in the heart of the South Valley which serves as the best represention of the importance of space to the very existence of the acequias and how the area of the South Valley plays a unique role in shaping public interactions and notions of the aceuqias. 

What exsists today in the South Valley in terms of its environment is a mix of the rich agricultural traditions first established by settlers of the Atrisco Land Grant, and an expanding urban development spurred by the city of Albuquerque and private developers. The expansion of Albuquerque through factors like modernization and gentrification has meant that acequias of the Atrisco operate in a semi-urban environment that is unique from the rural acequias throughout the rest of the state. The Arenal acequia runs through the South Valley beginning at the intersection of I-40 and coors running south, diverting at various points, to the border of the city limits and the Isleta Pueblo. 

The Sanchez Farms Open Space serves as a public area that highlights the hybrid reality of the South Valley acequias. The vast open space that sits beside the acequia is a dirt-shrub field within a basin and surrounded by a circular trail. At at the top of the basin, beside the acequia, is a circular patio area with rocks around the perimeter, effectively serving as chairs to sit upon. This makes the patio area ideal for social gatherings. The trail that follows the acequia south from this point runs though a diverse range of residential neighborhoods and farmlands. Along the trail it is easy to see where the acequia is diverted for agricultural purposes. The houses along the acequia that don't receive water highlight a dilemma of unclaimed water rights that exists within the community. Some residents have claims to use acequia water that they may not be aware of. The Center for Social Sustainable Systems (CESOSS) is a non-profit grass-roots organization that works within the South Valley community to help people claim these water rights in addition to fighting to preserve and maintain the acequia and its cultural traditions.

Walking along the acequia it can be easy to forget that you are actually less than one hundred yards from major streets, intersections, and commercial shopping centers. This close proximity to commercial centers and residential neighborhoods has made the acequia popular amongst walkers, runners and bike riders. 

The acequias of the South Valley have effectively transformed over the past hundred years from their traditional use as irrigation systems critical to agricultural society, to a public space that serves a dual function of providing an open recreational space for urban non-farmers, while maintaining its distiction as a sacred space that is of vital use to farmers.
