# Jerome's Introduction


Hello everyone! I hope everyone is enjoying the class. Let me introduce myself. I'm Jerome. I studying here at UNM and majoring in History and Psychology. I'm a huge history buff. I also like to draw, write, and go hiking. I like to think I'm a humorous person so I like to joke around alot. I'm also a movie fanatic. My favorite movies include...

  - Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade
  - Tremors 2
  - The Road to El Dorado
  - Employee of the Month
  
... among other movies.

I wish everyone the best of luck in this class. In the mean time, I'm going to try out this Markdown Language a little more.
