For example, if the city of Barcelona was chosen, the enclaves of that Jewish community could be explored by selecting one of the various tabs available. Each tab has an image of either a castle, flag, or menorah which enables access to various artifacts, historical sites, and heritage centers within the space.  This feature can also be accessed by the "View Places" tab on the righthand side of the screen. This allows for even easier exploration due to the highlighting effect that correspondes with each site. Once you have selected your tab for exploration, information regarding the history of that particular location including architectural information is provided. For example, *Calle de Banos Nuevos*, which translates to, *Street of New Bathrooms*, has long been a site used for public bathing starting in 1160 A.D. Throughout the website current images are provided to aid in spatial and visual perspective of the current state of the space being used. However, having more antiquated images of the sites would have further aided in understanding the space at the time of occupation. Nevertheless, additional **"Did you know?"** information is provided on why the sites are special to the Sephardic culture. For example, the Calle de Banos Nuevos,**"Did you know?"** image provides insight into the importance of bathrooms by way of the tradition of *Purification Baths.*
