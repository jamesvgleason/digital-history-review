Hello.

This simplistic markdown page shows how to link to images in your markdown files. We will be using screenshots to illustrate our critiques. This way we don't have to take lots of space describing what the website looks like. They are super easy to make once you get used to the procedure.

## How to Make Screenshots
- For Windows: <https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13776/windows-use-snipping-tool-to-capture-screenshots>.
- For Mac: <https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201361>

Remember, you need to save your screenshot image as a separate file that you will upload to the GitHub repository, into the `images` folder. I've put my screenshot from class in there as an example.


## Naming files
All the files we create from now on are destined to go on the web, both markdown and image files. For our future mental health, we should start being careful to name files appropriately, as they accumulate quickly. Following a few simple rules helps a ton:
- No spaces! All the files we create will ultimately be referenced in a URL, which cannot have spaces.
- Be clear. Don't turn the file names into a dectective investigation. They should be informative so that we can tell what they are two months from now.

If you're writing about the [AfricaMap project](http://worldmap.harvard.edu/africamap/), for instance, your critique should be named something like `africa-map.md`. Your images might be named `africa-map-1.jpg` and `africa-map-2.jpg` and so on.

## Linking to images in your markdown files
The syntax for displaying an image from your markdown file is as follows:
```
![ALT-TEXT](URL "HOVER-TEXT")
```
You need to replace ALT-TEXT, URL, and HOVER-TEXT for each of your images.

The `URL` is most important; it specifies the virtual location of your image. This is called the image `path`. In this case, we want to specify our `images` folder, because that's where we're uploading all our images.

`ALT-TEXT` is text that will appear if your image cannot be found (usually because there's a typo in the image path) 

`HOVER-TEXT` is text that will appear when you hover the cursor over the image. 

let's try: (you can copy this code into your own markdown page and change the URL to match your image)
```
![sample screen shot](images/image1.png "sample screen shot")
```

![sample screen shot](images/image1.png "sample screen shot")

It worked! Above you can see my screen shot I so carefully made in class on Thursday.

As you remember, by dragging and dropping an image file into the images folder (like you have already done with your test markdown files a few weeks ago), you can upload your image to the `images` folder in the `map-critiques` folder in the `docs` folder in our repository: <https://github.com/unm-digital-futures/digital-history-review>.
