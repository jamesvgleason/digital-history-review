  <h1 id="civiv-plazas-holocaust-memorial">Civiv Plaza’s Holocaust Memorial</h1>
<p>Dequez Irving</p>

<p>It would be kind of crazy to think a place like Albuquerque, New Mexico would have a holocaust memorial.And if they did then why would they ? Well for starters New Mexico is also a place of that has held numerous immigrants. With having people from different backgrounds means different cultures. Here in New Mexico there is many items around the state representing different cultures. As in the likes of artwork, food, music, clothes. Obviously the holocaust is apart the worlds history, but extremely apart of the jewish people’s history.</p>

<h2 id="the-location">The Location</h2>
<p>The Monument is located in downtown Alburquerque. Now for the monument there is pros and cons for it to be placed downtown. A pro can be the fact when most people come and visit, what do they like to ride through ? Obviously the downtown areas. Usually the downtown area is somewhere you can get the best feel for the city. That is also where most of the culture throughout the city can be found. A con be the same as the pro, is the fact that people just ride through downtown. They will not stop just to see a monument. This monument is actually kind of hidden behind another building. And surrounded By a parking garage. There is a couple of benches by the mounment, but not too many. So even though this is a very diverse piece it is very much hidden, in a well known area. Making this one New Mexico’s hidden treasures.

<h3 id="the-building-itself">The Building Itself</h3>
<p>The Holocaust mounment was built in 1998 by a sculptor Jake Lovato. There were also other designers on the building whose names are listed on the memorial. The date it was officially dediacted to the city was January 1st 1998. The monument was built with steel and granite pillars. The look of the building is a metal sculpture that depicts bodies rising in a smoke stack. Five triangular columns(panels) surrounding the sculpture and each columns includes info about the holocaust. Letting people know about important events of the holocaust and some things that went on during that period. Obviously with it being a memorial you can go visit it. Admission is free but some form of ID is required of the people visiting at the site. From a distance most people would think it is honestly nothing important. When the mounment lights at night or early in the afternoon when near it you can see the people and the smoke on the mounment.

<h4 id="controversy">Controversy</h4>
<p>While the monument was going through the process of getting built, there was a group of jewish people who did not want monument up. They felt like the monument’s figure showed too much. Due to the monument showing people burning in smoke. Which was something that exactly happened during the Holocaust.  During the summer of 2017 the monument had been vandaliezed for the second time. Glass on one of the panels were smashed. The memorial was rededicated in July according to KRQE news.</p>
