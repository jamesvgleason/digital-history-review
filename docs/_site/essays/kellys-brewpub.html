<p>Picture this, you just flew into Albuquerque and after a long flight all you want is a refreshing drink and some delicously fried food. As you leave the airport you stop someone next to you and ask for suggestions.  So following their recommendation you head down Central Ave. Parking in the back you walk around the building, find a seat outside and check out the menu. And there you see them, the core beers. Picking your favorite, you check the food section, your mouth watering as you read over the fried food section. Originally planning for a short lunch it turns hours long as you sip your beer and enjoy the eccentric gas station feel of Kelly’s Brew Pub.</p>

<p><img src="images/merin-historic-3.JPG" alt="Jones Motor Co." title="Jones Motor Co." /></p>

<p>Originally built in 1939 as Jones Motor Co. Ralph Jones (the creator of this historical site) commisioned this project, a service station, car dealership and gas station in 1939 with Tom Danahy as the architect and designer. The building served its intendended purpose until 1957 when Jones Motor Co. moved out and into a bigger, newer building farther down the street. After this decision the building had been used for various types of businesses, including at one point a <em>Goodwill</em> as well as a <em>Furniture Mart</em>.</p>

<p><img src="images/merin-historic-2.jpg" alt="During the Transitional Period" title="Transitional Period" /></p>

<p>In 1993 the building was nominated as a Historic Landmark, becoming a praised and protected piece of work. As one of the few examples of Moderne style, it was preserved for both its Architecural wonder but also due to its example of transportation and commerce in the fifties.</p>

<p>Finally in 1999 it was bought by Kellys Brewery and restored many of the original design, going as far as installing Texaco pumps and original garage doors. The building now houses Kelly’s Brew Pub on one side and a Cold stone on the opposite.</p>

<h3 id="design">Design</h3>
<p>The architect Tom Danahy designed the building in a Streamline Moderne style. A prevalent design at the end of the Art Deco period this design featuring smooth surfaces, curved edges and strong horizontal lines to give it a more aerodynamic feel. Danahy decided on a classing color scheme of white, red and black, a major color scheme at the time. Going along with this design Danahy placed the main entrance to the building on a corner, diagnal to the block in which it was built on. As you would face the intrance of the building there would be Texaco gas stations in the middle, the service station on the left and the car dealership on the right, complete with a large glass show room.

<p>Jones Motor Co. Is located on the corner of Central Ave. and Wellseley in the Nob Hill area of Southweast Albuquerque.</p>
<h5 id="central--route-66"><em>Central &amp; Route 66</em></h5>
<p>Until 1937 Route 66 had a completely different route. Instead of a straight western path between Tijeras and Grants. Before the realignment of Route 66 travelers would have to make a winding 107 mile trail through the state. In 1937 when the route was realigned to shave of this unncessary 107 miles the route was moved right through the previously dirt road of Central, becoming the only paved road in all of Albuuerque. With relocation came a fluctuation of people and travelers into the area, and soon businesses such as motor lodges, restaurants and retail stores became extremely prevalent to the area.</p>

<p>Jones Motor Co. was created with the its expressed location in mind. Located on Historic Route 66 (Central today) Ralph Jones wanted it to become a prominant local business that would attract customers from within Albuquerque as well as travelers. Jones was both the president of the Route 66 Association as well as the Albuquerque Chamber of Commerce and it was important to him to bring as much business into the area as possible.</p>

<p>Today, Route 66 has changed from the major highway it once was into clipped sections of its former glory.Now Jones Motor Co. or Kelly’s Brew Pub as its known as today sits on 3222 Central Avenue. Dispite the changes the area has historically faced, this area is still at the center of the city and the center of commerce. Located directly in the middle of the Nob Hill area the building is surrounded by small shops and restaurants. Directly across Central is a favorite is a craft beer hub called Matanza Beer Kitchen, diagonally across the intersection are cafes and frozen yogurt shops. Finally across Wellseley on the same side of Central is a jewelery store. On the same side of both Central and Wellsley directly west is the Hiway House Motel, with its own interesting back story.</p>
<h5 id="hiway-house-motel"><em>Hiway House Motel</em></h5>
<p><img src="images/merin-modern-5.jpg" alt="Hiway House Motel" title="Hiway House Motel" />
The Hiway House Motel was built in 1958, a year after Jone’s Motor Company had moved out. What makes this Hiway House Motel so unique and interesting is the fact that it mimics the color scheme of the Jones Motor Co. seemingly designed with the intention of complimenting the Jones Motor Co. even as the company itself has already moved out of the Area.</p>

<p>To add fule to this flame this specific  HiwayHouse Motel is one of if not the only location still in existance. In the 1960s the creator, Del Webb, sold the chain. It then was held many different companies until finally owned by Bicu Corporation who restored both the orignal sign as well as orignal design.</p>
