# Dictionary of Sydney 
This project is a source of every kind of history or culture of Sydney, Australia. The Dictionary of Sydney is designed to be a dicionary of culture and history, not of spefcific words only to be used when auto-correct sucks or when words "don't look right." The creators of The Dictionary preserves and displays history from a wide variety of categories. In order to keep the information as accurate and updated as possible in order to serve the global community better. An emphsis is made on Aboriginal Australia and the sensitive nature of the history behind the people. 
#### What Website is this About?
This website is a simple source for any cultural or historic information, from royal and political history to artistic and architectural to fashion history. You can find really any sort of thing about Sydney, the city specifically, you want. There are interesting parts of this website that add to the educational aspect that the website is portraying. It takes some searching but if you look through the webstie there's a blog aspect, that the website itself or other authors, can update on a topic or introduce a topic. This particular aspect is different from others by using the Dictionary of Sydney as a primary source. 
This website is a non-profit organization that is currently funded by only donations from individuals and sponsors, which one would know by the multitude of ads to donate and emphasis on tax exemptions. This is particularily annoying because that is not why one would visit the website. It is the only way the website is to exisist but still control on the advertisement would probably pull more visitors to the website. 
There are no maps in this website unless you specifically search for maps. So this is a basic informative search engine.

#### Who is the Inteneded Audience?
One would assume the audience is anyone interested in Sydney, Australia, obviously. The audience is people interested in this city but also certain topics that have a root of Sydney. The auidence is very broad and it could be possible for a child to use. There doesn't need to be improvements on it becuase the goal seems to be easy to access for everyone. That is a strong point of the website that most audiences are able to get what they need from this website.

#### The Format/Design
The homepage is beautifully built, easily accesible, and understandable. The homepage gives you a multitude of options that describe exactly what this website is about. It lists various topics that are divided into specific categories. The homepage also includes a search bar for you to search the entire website database in order find what you are looking for and give you the ability to go directly to what you want instead of clicking through the website. The website is very well structured and that is a strong suite of this project. Organization is very important when it comes to websites, especially one containing a large database such as this one. The organization is thought out and is simple enough for anyone to use. The downside to the search engine in the homepage is that you can't view what is possible to find, you have to dig through your option first. 
The website can also be viewed on a mobile device via iTunes or Android. That is super interesting. Everyday people in the world are constantly seeking an easily tool to look up random info and that really proves that any information is at our finger tips, even the most specific of topics. 
The language of this website is English with hints of grammatical adaptations. Australian English is very similar to American English but has little spelling and grammar differences. It doesn't make the website or any articles difficult to understand just catches the reader off guard.

#### Who Created this Website?
The Dictionary of Sydney was created by an Australian Research Council supported by the University of Sydney. Currently, it is ran by several univsersities and indiviuals that provide new projects to add to the collection. In addition to the large contributions, the Dictionary also serves the community by allowing the governments and everyday people to contribute. It specfically has a warning at the bottom of the page no matter where on the website you may visit. The warning is very sensitive and adds a sense of accuracy to the information that may be provided. It states that the stories of indigenous people of Australia, Aborignal's, could not have been known without the allowing of elders to contribute, it thanks them, and warns of possible "sadness and distress" that may occur. That in itself is very humbling to know that the indegous people were reached out to and respect enough to be thanked by "Country." It is very odd to have a website made out for educational reasons to warn of possible "sadness and distress."
