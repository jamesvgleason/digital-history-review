### Russian Gulag

The Soviet Union during the 20th Century was a turbulent time that's marked with oppression, expulsion, and incarceration. One cannot think of the Russian prison system without thinking of the gulag. The Russian gulag is the iconic symbol and epitomizes the Russian prison system at that time. The purpose of gulagmaps.org is to illustrate the construction, progression, and locations of  Russian penal institutions from the 1930s to the present.  

The site does an efficient job in obtaining data and recording information. Historians combed Russian archives to map the distribution of penal institutions throughout the country. Although prison locations are public domain, prisoner populations aren't. Therefore, prison populations were estimated by determining the prison's maximum prisoner population and multiplying the number of institutions in the area. The site acknowledges that the data isn't totally accurate but it's the only way in estimating prisoner populations. 

The maps are broken down into several series. The first series displays the distribution of camps beginning in 1929 to 1960. The second series displays the distribution of prisoners in the gulags from 1961 to 1960. The third series lists and displays the camp subdivisions throughout the country in 1952. The fourth series displays the penal institutions, prison hospitals, and correctional colonies throughout Russia. The fifth series display penal institutions in specific regions in Russia. Finally, the sixth series displays a juvenile colony for girls in 2007.

#### Series 1 
Series 1 provides the distribution of camps in the USSR from 1929-1960. The black dots on the pictures and video provided represent the camp locations in the country. This information is listed chronologically starting from 1939 to 1960. The star represents the capital of Moscow. Both the pictures and video indicate that camp locations steadily increase in the Eastern and Southern regions of the country.  These maps are beneficial because they’re simple and not too confusing.

#### Series 2
Series 2 is the distribution of prisoners in gulags from 1931-1960. Data from Russia and the USSR are listed chronologically. The black dots on the maps and video indicate the number of prisoners recorded. Black triangles indicate that no prisoner population was recorded. Maps in this series are color coded. White indicates no prisoner population in the region whereas red indicates 200,000-300,000 prisoner population.  These color-coded maps are beneficial because help the user to easily identifying and understanding the content.

#### Series 3
This series provides maps of camp sub-divisions, labor colonies, and settlement outposts in 1952. In the previous series, the map appearance was identical, whereas in this series they’re different. Each map displays a specific topic with its own information. For example; the “Location of Camp Headquarters” map display headquarters of colonies which are color-coded by region. However; the “Special Settler” map displays a specific region of Russia.  Colored circles indicating which job duty the settler is performing. The different maps in this series make it difficult for the user to understand or follow along.

#### Series 4
This series lists the numerous penal institutions and colonies for men, women, juvenile boys, and juvenile boys. This series has the same problem as series 3, there are different maps with different information.  The “Prison Hospital” map displays the distribution of hospitals throughout Russia. A population 30,000,00 million is indicated by a star. In the “Correctional Colonies for Women,” the same population is indicated with a triangle. The maps should be universal to prevent the user from being confused.

#### Series 5
Series 5 displays the numerous penal institutions in the regions around Russia. Along with Series 3 and 4, the maps and information are different. One map displays the 15 republics of the USSR, but another map shows the rate of imprisonment in European Russia. Although they provide great visualization of penal locations, the differing images make it difficult to locate and access.

#### Series 6
Series 6 displays the juvenile colonies for girls in 2007. There's only one image which shows a layout of the female penal facility. It's a detailed depiction of the facility which is equipped with perimeter walls, barbed wire, and watchtower. This is a haunting but essential visualization of the institution that the user should understand.

These maps and additional images offer a visual representation of gulag locations which couldn't be seen or understood otherwise. These gulag maps are not to be understood alone, but it should be used to support and complements the primary information.
