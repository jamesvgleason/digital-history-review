The project that I will be go to critique is called **DiscoverEDINA.** This website was last current in December of 2016. To see the website itself it is avialable right here. http://wwwold.edina.ac.uk/projects/discoveredina_summary.html. To visulally see this website here's the screenshot of the home page ![DiscoverEDINA](images/JAScreenshot1.png "DiscoverEdina Homepage")
In this website, it is taking a look at the problem area's of Resource Discovery Taskforce. These problem services are:
 * GeoT
 * Jisc MediaHub
 * SUNCAT
  
 At the bottome of the webpage, there are contacts given to ask questions about each of the services. Below this the site gives examples to other resources and links that would further explore what the article is talking about. A few of these links that will be analyzed further will be:
* DiscoverEdnia
* GoGeo as Linked Data
* Jisc MediaHub
* SUNCAT
* SUNCAT Exploring Linked Metadata
 
 These services are supposed to help with creating specific points of data to help enhance, or to help reuse the data that is already there. The services are also there to help erase data that may be out of date. The first of this data that will be analyzed is GeoT, as it appears first on the website.

### The First Program: GeoT

According to the site, GeoT is the one service the project goes into greater detail on. Such as them providing an explination of what this service does. The service uses open source resources to enable the user to find and reuse the data they would need to use for their maps. It does through:
* Wrapping the data into a usable web source
* Using multimedia resources
* Embedding geographic data 
* Offers a basic service for people to use easily

Below the explanation is a list of the things GeoT does. Among this list is a link to a website that is no longer in service. As when the link is clicked you get this page. Here's a screenshot of what you get: ![Website no longer working](images/JAScreenshot2.png "Website no longer working")
As this link is no longer working, it is no longer feasable to view what this part of the project has to offer. 
Upon looking at the additional resources, to further see how this program is used, it is the **GoGeo as Linked Data** link. When clicked, it will take us to another project that has more to do with the SUNCAT part with this project. ![SUNCAT Project](images/JAScreenshot3.png "Other Project")
In all the site doesn't give a good example of how GeoT is utilized, and it isn't very clear on how to even properly use the program. If the links took us to the proper places, then it would be more accurate to see how it works. With these links no longer working, the next project comes into question. 

### The Second Program: Jisc MediaHub

For this program, the project does not go into great detail of what this program does. According to the site this program enables the user to use:
* Video Resources
* Image Resources
* Audio Resources

These resources are used to give the collections of these resources better data to do their research. It does these things to give a support to give the users to be able to find their data much more easier, along with a summary of how these services are better used for other projects. The other resource at the bottom of the page for the project is the site itself, **Jisc MediaHub**. This gives the user a better understanding of how the program works. This program is then used with the next project and that is SUNCAT.

### The Final Program: SUNCAT

This program is broken up into two parts, **SUNCAT** and **SUNCAT Exploring Linked Metadata**. For the first part, it provides examples from various libraries and collections. It will also take further examples from the second part, refered on the project as Phase 1, to provide further examples to open up the program even more. The project provides a PDF file, explaining this. ![PDF file](images/JAScreenshot4.png "PDF explaining the program")
This PDF provides an explination as well as some link to further explainhow the program works for the user. 
Upon clicking the additional resources you are taken to this page. https://suncat.ac.uk/search. An image of the homepage is here: ![Working Home Page](images/JAScreenshot5.png "Working page with a map")
The best part of this site is it actually contains a map of where all the libries the program uses to give you an idea where they are located. The other sites and programs didn't really do that, because they didn't work most of the time.

#### Conclusion

The project **DiscoverEDINA,** doesn't hold up today. The links don't work half the time. It does not go into great detail into what each of these programs do. It only has one site that uses a map to give an idea into what it does. Its borderline does not feel like a GS project in the slightest.
