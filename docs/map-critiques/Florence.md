Hidden FLorence Critique

By: Sara Lopez

The author of the Hidden Florence map website intended for his website to be used as a resource for people to explore the 1940’s Renaissance city through the eyes of Giovanni, a wool worker who was very familiar with the area. This site is used as a broad source of guidelines for an app that guides to historical sites while being in the city of Florence "kind of like Pokémon GO" as the author describes it.
The website is created for people who are interested in going to Florence itself and taking a walk throughout the city to learn more about monuments and places that were influential to Giovanni as he would travel by regularly. The point of the website is to be accompanied an app as a guide throughout Florence tourists to places that are generally over looked. On the website there is some information, stories, and current photos of each mark on the map.
The main heading tab is “Stories” that tell about a daily journey of Giovanni and the history of what he generally would see regularly. Within this there are two main walks that a tourist might be interested in, the “City Centre Walk” and “Saint Ambrogio Walk.” They each have nine stories that are listed and can be clicked on to read what that spot was about and a current photo of the area. At the end of each story is accompanied by a different author of the sites information with a citation of where they got their information from. 
The website itself does not initially show a map of where the “tour” is supposed to be taken. It is found through searching through the tabs at the top of the websites page and clicking separately through each different tab. Finally found on the last tab labeled “Download,” once on the download page at the very bottom a label under the “Maps” heading two titles of the walks then one can view a map of each walk. It is important that the website should show where on a map that the tour would be taken at without having to search too much because that is the main point of the website. On the maps there are numbers that match each of the numbered stories in order. This is only known by downloading the app. The maps are the same, but to find out what the numbers mean on the website one must, for instance, find the number one labeled on the website and the app map by clicking on it and comparing the historical photo to the updated photo on the website and using a common-sense judgment to make the comparison. But to also make sure reading the article and listening to the podcast is also the best way to officially make sure, even though they are different listening to see if they are the same place and creating an understanding that the author of the story on the website and the voice of Giovanni are at the same place.
The writing style of the website is informational and easy for any type of audience, both ones that don’t know much or enough about Florence. Three of the eight tabs at the top of the page are useful of information about the hidden Florence experience. The other five have some information that can be clicked through as feedback to the author of the website but not necessary to the user for researching information about Giovanni’s 1940’s experience.
