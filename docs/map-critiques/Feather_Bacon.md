Christopher Warren and Daniel Shore of Carnegie Melon University put together a great visualization of Francis Bacon’s six degrees of separation.

Upon first entering the site you are greeted with a well done youtube video tutorial on the background of the project and a brief tutorial on how to use the interface. The most difficult part of this website was my lack of knowledge of England from 1500 to 1700. After browsing some of the information in the groups section,  I wanted to see how far separated some members from the East India Company were from the King and Queen.

As it turns out Sir Edwin Sandys knew King James the First and Fourth, King James IV knew William Shakespeare and Queen Elizabeth I.

This website has a great level of transparency in accessing the raw data behind the networking web.

This data base gives you some basic information about the people within, such as dates they were alive, gender, historical significance, and relationships. The information is from two sources firstly the [Oxford Dictionary of National Biography](http://www.oxforddnb.com/index/0/101000990/) and secoundly crowd sourced information that is then vetted by people who have previously contributed. This is a cost effective way of sourcing information, but may lead to some amount of false information. [Play around with it](http://www.sixdegreesoffrancisbacon.com/) and see how you like it!
