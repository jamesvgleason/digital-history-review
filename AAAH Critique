<h2><a id="Main_point_of_the_site_2"></a>Main point of the site</h2>
<p>The point of animated atlas of history is to be able to give people a more in depth look.<br>
Into the land/ country of Africa. Another main creation of this website.<br>
Is to allow people to have fun while exploring Africa online.<br>
By allowing people on the to click on different spots on the maps, and having info that certain area pop up.<br>
People can also move across Africa.<br>
Helping them see all sides of africa and understand the country as a whole.<br>
Seeing as this site is animated and all the movement in this site, this site has to be meant for kids.<br>
The creator of this site is very smart for animating this site, because even though it is made for kids it can easy catch adults attention.<br>
The reason I personally think it is meant for kids besides the animation, is the fact you click anywhere and information pops up abut that certain area.<br>
Plus the information that pops up is not hard to understand. They all come with pictures to help you get a better visual of the info.<br>
This site is simply trying to describe the country of Africa and it’s history between the years of 1879 to 2002.<br>
And honsetly this site could be made to help people see the country’s growth overtime.<br>
This is one of those rare sites that could be used for mulitple reasons, having to do with reasearch.</p>
<h3><a id="What_I_liked_about_the_site_16"></a>What I liked about the site</h3>
<p>The best part is the info it provides and how easy it is to comprehend it.<br>
Like in one of the pages it explains what AAAH is and who is in it.<br>
Also who help create it and why it was created.<br>
I really love how they go a little more into detail about the AAAH.<br>
As what the look of the group is and how it is structured.<br>
With information like that would make this site very reliable.<br>
All that information can be found under the About tab.<br>
Another thing that caught my attention was the introduction.<br>
Just due to the fact most websites do not usually have intros into their sites.<br>
The intro to the site gives you a brief insight about the site.<br>
Some of the topics that will be covered or visualize in this website.<br>
And after seeeing this site had a intro, got me thinking that all sites should have a intro.<br>
Instead of just letting you skim through a site to look for information that might not even be in the site.<br>
Intros help you understand the main and few minor ideas you might be reading or researching.<br>
This site also does a good job with it’s tabs, as in labeling them.<br>
The tabs labels are introductions, map, about, notes, tables, sources, feedback.<br>
All of them relating to the topic of African history.<br>
Plus whats also good about the tabs is when you get in to, them how the information stays on track with the topic.<br>
a really impressive part of this site is they provided where they got their from sources from.<br>
They made a tab for it, so everyone can see their sources.</p>
<h4><a id="Issues_with_the_site_37"></a>Issues with the site</h4>
<pre><code>    One of the problems i have with this site is since it's animated is there should be more videos.
    The videos could help people see what the information on the page was trying to explain.
    Or the videos can explain something the information in the text did not.
    Majority of the site has a grey background.
    Usually grey is a boring, sad, dark color.
    They should a color that brightens up the site, instead of a color that could brings instead boredom.
    And if they are trying to get this site to appeal to kids they should, have more kid like drawings.

<h4><a id="Overvall_Conclusion_on_the_site_45"></a>Overvall Conclusion on the site</h4>
<p>This is one of the best sites i have ever seen.<br>
Since being taught how to critique sites.<br>
They have the basic information needed, they have pictures that help explain the text.<br>
They have a map helping explain African history during the time periods of 1879 - 2002<br>
They provide a publishing company and date.<br>
What put this site over the top was them mentioning their sources.<br>
Which i had already mentioned before.<br>
Another main thing is they make it obvious who their target audience is.<br>
Overall the site was very well put together, in a organized way that is simple to understand.</p>
